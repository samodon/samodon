### Hello, I am Jovane Samuels.

My interest in computer science and software development began when I saw my father, a computer technician, fixing computers. I was fascinated by the complexity and inner workings of these machines. This fascination led me to pursue a degree in computer science at Central Michigan University, where I gained a strong foundation in programming and software development principles.
