### Hello, I am Jovane Samuels.

My interest in computer science and software development began when I saw my father, a computer technician, fixing computers. I was fascinated by the complexity and inner workings of these machines. This fascination led me to pursue a degree in computer science at Central Michigan University, where I gained a strong foundation in programming and software development principles. My current focus areas are `UI design` and `AI algorithms`.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [**Cyber Gym**](https://github.com/samodon/WorkOutUpdatedUI) a gamified workout app powered by AI vision models to promote exercise.
